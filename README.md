# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google

### What is the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive?
This 5-day online course was crafted by Google’s ML researchers and engineers to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. You’ll learn the core components – models, tools, orchestration, memory and evaluation. Finally, you’ll discover how agents move beyond LLM prototypes to become production-ready systems.

Each day blends conceptual deep dives with hands-on examples, codelabs, and live discussions. By the end, you’ll be ready to build, evaluate, and deploy agents that solve real-world problems.


## Course
The course is designed to be flexible and interactive, allowing you to learn at your own pace while benefiting from live sessions and community engagement.
* Daily Content Release: New assignments will be posted each day on this Kaggle course page - your primary source for all course materials.
